# Repository for a professor guided college project.

Hey, I am Nandini Bansal, a 1st year Electronics and Communication Engineering student. \
I'm currently working with my college professor on a project that uses Markdown to display scientific notations and mathematical symbols on computers. \
\
Beyond working on this project, I have a growing interest in Game Development, Web Development, VLSI Chip Design and Digital Design.  
I enjoy experimenting with stuff that merges creativity with technical aspects.
